chml-ontology
=============

An ontology aligned to CHML schema and based on the CIDOC CRM / Erlangen CRM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ontology combines the [Cultural Heritage Markup Language](http://chml.foundation )
(CHML, an XML schema aimed at documentation of 3D reconstruction of cultural heritage) with the [CIDOC CRM](http://cidoc-crm.org), using its OWL-DL implementation [Erlangen CRM](http://erlangen-crm.org).

The reduced version 1.1 of the CHML ontology contains several specifications and the fundamental parts
of 3D reconstruction as well as a documentation of the classes.
